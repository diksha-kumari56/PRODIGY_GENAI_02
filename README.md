# PRODIGY_GENAI_02 – Image Generation using Pre-trained Models

## 💼 Task
This is Task 02 of my Generative AI Internship at *Prodigy Infotech*.  
In this task, I used pre-trained models to generate images from prompts.

## 🛠 What I Did
- Used a pre-trained model like *Stable Diffusion* or *DALL·E*
- Provided text prompts to generate realistic or artistic images
- Saved and visualized the output images

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers / diffusers
- OpenAI API or Stability AI
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 📚 What I Learned
- How text-to-image generation works
- How to use pre-trained models for visual creativity
- Working with large generative models like DALL·E or Stable Diffusion
